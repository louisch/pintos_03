\section{System Calls}
\subsection{Data Structures}
\paragraph{B1:} % (10 marks)
Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

\subparagraph{process.c global static variables}

\begin{verbatim}
/* The lock for the below hash table */
static struct lock process_info_lock;
/* Maps pids to process_infos. Also serves to keep track of all
   processes that exist. */
static struct hash process_info_table;
\end{verbatim}

The `process\_info\_table' keeps tracks of process information. Each process's
information is stored in a `process\_info' struct (see below). Hashes by pid.

\begin{verbatim}
/* Used for allocating pids. */
static struct lock next_pid_lock;
\end{verbatim}

This is only used for allocating pids. This is to lock a static variable that
is local to the function that allocates the pids.

\subparagraph{process\_info}

\begin{verbatim}
/* Data for a process used for syscalls. */
typedef struct process_info
{
  /* Process ID. */
  pid_t pid;
  /* ID of the thread owned by the process. */
  tid_t tid;

  /* Exit status of process. */
  int exit_status;
  /* Lock to synchronise access to children hashtable. */
  struct lock children_lock;
  /* Tracks the process's children, running or terminated,
     which have not been waited on. */
  struct hash children;
  /* Pointer to parent's child_info struct. */
  struct child_info *parent_child_info;

  /* For placing process_info in hash table mapping pids to process_info. */
  struct hash_elem process_elem;

  unsigned fd_counter;
  struct hash open_files;

} process_info;
\end{verbatim}

`process\_info' represents various pieces of information attached to a running process
that needs to be saved. The struct is destroyed upon process termination.

\subparagraph{child\_info}

\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct child_info
{
  /* Child process's ID, used when checking if a child belongs to a parent. */
  pid_t pid;
  /* Exit status of thread. */
  int exit_status;
  /* Indicates whether the child process is still running. */
  bool running;
  /* Pointer to parent wait semaphore. Is NULL if the parent is not waiting. */
  struct semaphore *parent_wait_sema;
  /* Pointer to child process_info. */
  process_info *child_process_info;
  /* Hash elem to be placed into process_info's children hash. */
  struct hash_elem child_elem;

} child_info;
\end{verbatim}

The child\_info struct, stored in the parent process\_info's children hash, saves information about that process's children, even after its children's process\_infos have been destroyed.

\paragraph{B2:} % (5 marks)
Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files. Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a single process?

\subsection{Algorithms}
\paragraph{B3:} % (5 marks)
Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the kernel.

\paragraph{B4:} % (5 marks)
Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table (e.g. calls to pagedir\_get\_page()) that might result?  What about for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room for improvement in these numbers, and how much?

\paragraph{B5:} % (5 marks)
Briefly describe your implementation of the ``wait'' system call and how it interacts with process termination.

There are 3 main places where code has been inserted: in process creation (in process\_execute\_aux()), in process termination (in process\_exit()) and in process\_wait.

Upon process creation, the child's process\_info is created, and its child\_info is created and inserted into the current process's children hashtable. Both structures have their values initialised, and also point to each other through the parent\_child\_info and child\_process\_info pointers.

Upon process termination, we need to inform both the process's parent and all its children. We first check whether the process still has a parent. This is indirectly determined by checking whether it still has a child\_info (by checking if parent\_child\_info is not NULL). If so, we update the child\_info's exit status and and running fields, thus indirectly informing the parent that its child has terminated. We also check whether the parent is waiting on the child to exit (by checking if wait\_for\_child is not NULL), and if so we up the semaphore and unblock the parent.

We then inform all the process's children that their child\_info no longer exists, and we do this by setting the parent\_child\_info pointer in the child's process\_info to NULL when destroying the parent's children hashtable (in the children\_hash\_destroy() function).

N.B. the signature of process\_wait() has been changed to take a pid as an argument. This is more intuitive since this function waits on a process (and thus indirectly on the process's thread), and also allows the children hashtable to be indexed by pid. If it were to be indexed by tid, calling the wait system call (which takes a pid) would have to look into the process\_info which matches that pid to retrieve its tid to pass to process\_wait(), which is not possible when the process\_info no longer exists i.e. after the process has terminated.

When process\_wait() is called, it first looks in the current process's children hashtable whether it has a child with that pid. If not, then that process is either not a child, or it has already been waited on, but in either case -1 is returned. If it is found, then we must check whether it is still running. If so, we must create a semaphore, tell the child about this, and then wait for the child by blocking. After the child has exited (or if it was already finished), we then retrieve the exit status from the child\_info and return it. We also remove the child\_info from the children hashtable to ensure it cannot be waited on again.

Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such accesses, e.g. a ``write'' system call requires reading the system call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for managing these issues.  Give an example.

\subsection{Synchronization}

\paragraph{B7:} % (5 marks)
The ``exec'' system call returns -1 if loading the new executable fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls ``exec''?

\paragraph{B8:} % (5 marks)
Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are there any special cases?



\subsection{Rationale}

\paragraph{B9:} % (5 marks)
Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the kernel in the way that you did?
