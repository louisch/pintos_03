\part{Memory Mapped Files}

\section{Data Structures}

% Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
% `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
% enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

\section{Algorithms}

% Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
% memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
% processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

% Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
% any existing segment.

\section{Rationale}

% Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of
% data demand-paged from executables, except that "mmap" mappings are
% written back to their original files, not to swap.  This implies
% that much of their implementation can be shared.  Explain why your
% implementation either does or does not share much of the code for
% the two situations.
