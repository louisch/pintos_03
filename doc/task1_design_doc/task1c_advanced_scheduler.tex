% Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or `struct' member,
% global or static variable, `typedef', or enumeration.  Identify the purpose of
% each in 25 words or less.

Listed here is a list of files that have new or changed `struct' or `struct'
members, global or static variable, `typedef', or enumeration.

\begin{description}

\item[(src/lib/kernel/fixed\_point.h)] This file provides fixed point
  operations.

\begin{verbatim}
typedef int fixed_point;
\end{verbatim}
  This is a typedef int which represents the type fixed\_point. The use
  of the typedef is to help with readability of code.

\item[(src/threads/mlfqs.c)] This file provides provides the bulk of the
  functionality for the advanced scheduler.

\begin{verbatim}
/* Estimates the average number of threads ready to run over the
   past minute. */
static fixed_point load_avg = 0;
\end{verbatim}

  This variable is used to store the value of load\_avg somewhere so that it may
  be fetched at any time for testing.

\begin{verbatim}
static struct list ready_array[PRI_NUM];
\end{verbatim}

  ready\_array is an array of queues of threads. Allows lookup of threads by
  priority. PRI\_NUM is PRI\_MAX - PRI\_MIN.

\item[(src/threads/thread.h)]
  A diff of the changes made to struct thread:

  \begin{description}

  \item[int nice] A factor which determines the CPU time a thread takes or gives
    out to other threads. Threads with higher nice decays in priority faster.

  \item[fixed\_point recent\_cpu] The amount of CPU time this thread has received
    recently.

  \item[struct list\_elem mlfqs\_elem] Allows threads to be placed inside
    ready\_array.

% Suppose threads A, B, and C have nice values 0, 1, and 2.  Each has a
% recent\_cpu value of 0.  Fill in the table below showing the scheduling
% decision and the priority and recent\_cpu values for each thread after each
% given number of timer ticks:

Assuming that no other threads apart from these three exist, so that only these
three are ever considered for running.

\paragraph{B3:} % (5 marks)
% Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values in the table
% uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve them?  Does this match the
% behaviour of your scheduler?

The order in which threads are chosen from the highest priority queue is
unspecified, and furthermore, the frequency with which the current thread should
be yielded is also unspecified.

The rules we used to resolve these ambiguities are the same as the ones that we
implemented in our scheduler.

We decided to simply add threads to the end of their respective queue when
yielding or unblocking, and to pop the first thread when fetching the next
thread to run. This FIFO strategy ensures we rotate through all threads in the
highest priority queue.

As for the frequency of yields, we simply yield every tick.

\paragraph{B4:} % (5 marks)
% How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code inside and
% outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

\subsection{Rationale}
\paragraph{B5:} % (5 marks)
% Briefly critique your design, pointing out advantages and disadvantages in
% your design choices.  If you were to have extra time to work on this part of
% the task, how might you choose to refine or improve your design?

\paragraph{B6:} % (5 marks)
% The assignment explains arithmetic for fixed-point mathematics in detail, but
% it leaves it open to you to implement it.  Why did you decide to implement it
% the way you did?  If you created an abstraction layer for fixed-point
% mathematics, that is, an abstract data type and/or a set of functions or
% macros to manipulate fixed-point numbers, why did you do so?  If not, why not?
